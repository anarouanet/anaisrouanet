I am a postdoctoral researcher working at the Bordeaux Population Health research center (Inserm U1219), Biostatistics team. My main areas of research are the development of biostatistical methods for the analysis of longitudinal data, time-to-event data and semi-supervised clustering.

In 2017-2019, I worked at the Institute of Public Health, Medical Research Council, Cambridge University, in the Biostatistics Unit, on the development of Bayesian methods for clustering from longitudinal data and correlated covariates.

In 2016, I was awarded my Ph.D. in Public Health, Biostatistics, from the Bordeaux University.
